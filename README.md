# Internship-Application-Automation
This project is a complete automation script which finds relevant internships according to your domain, modifies your base resume based upon each internship description and applies to the same. As of now, this automation operates on internshala.com. The script is highly sensitive to the internshala's architecture. Any change to the the website's architecture in the future may subject to failure of the script. The flow diagram below summarizes the architecture of this automation.
